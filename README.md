Data Sructures in Java, A Laboratory Course, by Sandra Anderson, is a textbook that was recommended to me by my mentor.
The textbook comes with source code for the labs.
I spent many weeks of this summer working on these labs, and I feel they gave me a stronger knowledge of data structures and algorithms, especially in Java.
